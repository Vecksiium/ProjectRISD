"BadRecovery (formerly OlyBmmer) is an exploit for ChromeOS devices, leveraging a vulnerability in recovery images to get arbitrary code execution or to chain to other exploits.

BadRecovery unenrolls ALL devices that are EOL before 2024, and can unenroll current supported devices on kernel version 3 or lower."

BadRecovery is revolutionary in UnEnrollment Exploits because of the fact that it works on kernel version 3, prevoius exploits only worked on 2 and lower.
